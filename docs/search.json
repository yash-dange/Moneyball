    "text": "1 Introduction\nNovember 30th, 2023 EDAV Professor Robbins\nMoneyball - How to win the Premier League (Tyler Freund, Yash Dange)\nBackground on our Data:\nThe Premier League is the most prestigious and highest level of competitive\nsoccer in England.  It is the most followed soccer league in the world,\nproducing the biggest superstars in the sport and the strongest teams.  The\npremier league brought in over $6.9 billion dollars in revenue between\n2021-2022 and amassed over 4.7 billion viewers.  Given that this league is\nfollowed by such a large number of people and brings in such vast amounts of\nrevenue, better understanding why and how certain teams excel is an incredibly\nfascinating and important topic.  We were able to gather a diverse collection\nof datasets that cover a wide range of details relating to the teams in this\nleague.\nWhy you chose this topic:\nWe wanted to find a dataset we were both passionate about and interested in.  \nAfter extensive searching and exploring of datasets we decided to use the\npremier league soccer datasets.  We chose these datasets because we both love\nsports and believe we can find meaningful trends in the data that help\ndetermine what makes a winning team.  By identifying characteristics of\nwinning and losing teams we can help fans, investors, and teams themselves\nbetter understand what makes them successful.\nQuestions you are interested in studying:\nAs mentioned above, we want to discover what makes a winning team in the\npremier league. More concretely, we can research the attributes and statistics\nthat are most highly correlated with winning and losing. For instance, do\nhigher salaries mean a better chance of winning? How much more likely is a\nteam to win based on a winning previous season? Are teams with a strong player\nin a certain position more likely to win? We delve into these questions and\nmany more regarding how a team can become successful."

    "text": "Data Description: Technical, Research Approach and Missing Value Analysis\n2.1 Technical Description\nGiven the popularity of the sport and its apex league, it is not surprising to see the manifold sources which can be used to book-keep the data of the Premier League and its individual fixtures. Some popular sources are:\n\nPremier League Official Website: The official Premier League website offers statistics, fixtures, results, and historical data. While it might not provide APIs, the website itself is a good reference for up-to-date information.\nFootball Data APIs: o Opta: Opta provides detailed sports data, including football. They offer APIs that cover various football leagues, including the Premier League, delivering statistics, match events, player data, and more.\n\no Sportradar: Sportradar offers APIs with live and historical data for various sports, including football. Their services cover detailed match data, player statistics, and more for the Premier League.\n\nStatistical Websites: o Whoscored: Whoscored provides detailed statistics, including player ratings, team performance, and match data for various football leagues, including the Premier League.\n\no Transfermarkt: While primarily known for transfer-related data, Transfermarkt also offers comprehensive statistics, player information, and historical data for the Premier League.\n\nOpen Source Datasets: o GitHub Datasets: Some repositories on GitHub host curated football datasets, including Premier League data. You can find historical match results, player statistics, and more.\nAPI Platforms: o RapidAPI: Platforms like RapidAPI aggregate multiple APIs, including sports data providers. You can find football-related APIs on RapidAPI that cover the Premier League.\n\nFor the purpose of this project, we have taken into consideration the previous season of the Premier League (Season 2022/23) which concluded in May. This will allow us to perform in -depth analysis of an entire season.\nSOURCES USED:\nSource 1: Football Referee (https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/2022-2023-Premier-League-Stats)\nDescription: The dataset consists detailed records of the recently concluded 22/23 season of the English Premier League. It includes various metrics like possession, goalkeeping, playmaking, passing, etc and provides information from a twofold perspective (squad and v/s the squad). Provides ample opportunities for different observations using all kinds of graphs and plots.\nFormat: Excel Sheets (.xlsx) and Comma Separated Values (.csv) files. Frequency of Updates: Every Match-Week. (Note: Since we have taken into account the last season, there will be no additions or changes to the dataset used. The ‘weekly’ frequency refers to the usual timeline of football matches in the English Premier League held usually held every Saturday & Sunday, with exceptions being International Breaks, Emergencies and off-season breaks.)\nDimensions: 20 X 15 (Each sheet consists of different number of columns, depending on the aspect of the game it records. 15 is just a rough estimate of how many features may be present in each. The teams, however, stay the same and hence all sheets have 20 rows.)\nOther relevant information: For the uninitiated, certain terms commonly used in Football (or Soccer, in America) might feel like jargon. Hence, one can find the “glossary” section in the source link itself to better understand the meaning & full forms of abbreviations used as column names.\nPotential Shortcomings of the dataset: 1. No categorical variables as such – All features are of numerical datatypes. This is a nature of the sport itself, which demands limited ‘categorical’ input for analysis. 2. Needs Pre-processing and Cleaning - Data is spread into 23 different sheets (each acting as a dataset on its own) 3. Limited Size – The dataset consists of only 20 rows in each sheet, representing all 20 teams. This is different from a usual csv file which might consist millions of rows of data.\nSource 2: Official Website of the Premier League (https://www.premierleague.com/)\nThis is the official website of the English Premier League and acts as the official platform for all news, stats and records of the league. We primarily plan to use this as a ‘fact-check’ source to ensure the data represented on the third party source is authentic and not fabricated. Besides, the website also contains information not relevant to the purpose of our assignment.\nExternal Sources which might possible aid our research question (Financial Aspects) - https://www.transfermarkt.us/\n2.2 Research plan\nThe research question we’re primarily trying to answer is – “What makes a Premier League Champion?”\nAnalyzing a Premier League dataset to understand the key factors that contribute to a team becoming a champion involves exploring various aspects of the game. Here’s a detailed approach:\n\nPerformance Metrics: Goals Scored and Conceded. Explore the relationship between a team’s goal-scoring ability and defensive solidity. Champions often have a high goal-scoring rate coupled with a solid defense. Possible Graphs – Line Chart, Bar Chart.\nPossession and Style of Play: Possession Statistics: Examine possession stats to understand if champions tend to dominate possession or are effective in counter-attacking. Passing Accuracy and Style: Analyze passing accuracy and patterns to determine if champions have a particular style of play (possession-based, direct play, etc.) Possible Graphs – Area Chart, Heatmap.\nEfficiency and Expected Goals (xG): Expected Goals (xG): Evaluate expected goals statistics to gauge a team’s offensive efficiency. Compare actual goals scored to expected goals to identify teams that overperform or underperform based on expected metrics. Possible Graphs - Scatter Plot, Line Chart.\nDefensive Strength: Clean Sheets and Goals Conceded: Assess the number of clean sheets and goals conceded by champions. A strong defense is often a crucial factor in winning the title. Possible Graphs - Bar Chart/ Line Chart.\nIndividual Player Performance: Key Player Contributions: Analyze individual player statistics such as top goal scorers, assists, key passes, successful tackles, interceptions, etc., to identify the impact of star players on the team’s success. Possible Graphs – Bar Chart, Radar Chart. Additional Data from the same source (FBRef) will be required for individual player analysis*\nGoalkeeping Performance: Goalkeeper Stats: Evaluate goalkeeper statistics such as save percentage, clean sheets, saves made, etc., to understand the influence of goalkeeping on the team’s success. Possible Graphs - Bar Chart or Pie Chart. Illustrating goalkeeper statistics like save percentage, clean sheets, saves made, etc., for different goalkeepers.\nTackles Won and Defensive Actions: Tackles and Defensive Stats: Assess the number of tackles won, interceptions, blocks, clearances, etc., to understand a team’s defensive work rate and effectiveness.Possible Graphs - Bar Chart or Area Chart: Displaying tackles won, interceptions, blocks, clearances, etc., to showcase defensive actions.\nConsistency and Form: Home vs. Away Performance: Analyze a team’s performance at home versus away games to understand consistency. Form Across the Season: Check for streaks, runs of consecutive wins, and periods of good form to identify critical phases of the season for champions. Plot: Line Chart/ Area Chart\nMatch Analysis: Results Against Top Teams: Analyze results against direct competitors or top teams to understand the team’s performance in crucial matches. Performance in Critical Fixtures: Evaluate performance in high-pressure matches towards the end of the season. Plot: Line/Bar Chart\n\nBy dissecting and analyzing various facets of the dataset as mentioned above, we can uncover patterns and trends that distinguish championship-winning teams in the Premier League. Integrating multiple metrics and adopting a holistic approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of our research question - What makes a Premier League champion?\n2.3 Missing Value Analysis\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(reshape2)\n\n\n\nAttaching package: 'reshape2'\n\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:tidyr':\n\n    smiths\n\n\nCode\nfile_path &lt;- \"EPL (Names).xlsx\"\ndata &lt;- read_excel(file_path)\ncount_null_values &lt;- function(df) {\n  colSums(is.na(df))\n}\nnull_counts &lt;- count_null_values(data)\nprint(null_counts)\n\n\nUnnamed: 0_level_0 Unnamed: 1_level_0 Unnamed: 2_level_0 Unnamed: 3_level_0 \n                 0                  0                  0                  0 \n        Pass Types       Pass Types.1       Pass Types.2       Pass Types.3 \n                 0                  0                  0                  0 \n      Pass Types.4       Pass Types.5       Pass Types.6       Pass Types.7 \n                 0                  0                  0                  0 \n      Corner Kicks     Corner Kicks.1     Corner Kicks.2           Outcomes \n                 0                  0                  0                  0 \n        Outcomes.1         Outcomes.2 \n                 0                  0 \n\n\nCode\n# bar plot of null vs non null counts by field\nnon_null_counts &lt;- colSums(!is.na(data))\nplot_data &lt;- data.frame(columns = names(non_null_counts),\n                        counts = non_null_counts,\n                        null_counts_0 = non_null_counts == 0)\n\nplot_data_gathered &lt;- plot_data %&gt;%\n  gather(key = \"value_type\", value = \"count\", -columns)\nggplot(plot_data_gathered, aes(x = columns, y = count, fill = value_type)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\", alpha = 0.8) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"counts\" = \"skyblue\", \"null_counts_0\" = \"red\"), \n                    name = \"Count Type\",\n                    labels = c(\"Non-null\", \"Null count of 0\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Columns\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Null and Non-null Values in Columns\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# heatmap of non null values\nnon_null_matrix &lt;- !is.na(data)\nnon_null_df &lt;- melt(non_null_matrix)\nggplot(non_null_df, aes(x = Var2, y = Var1, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"TRUE\" = \"green\", \"FALSE\" = \"red\", \"NA\" = \"red\"), \n                    name = \"Non-null\",\n                    na.value = \"NA color\") +\n  labs(x = \"Columns\", y = \"Rows\", title = \"Presence of Non-null Values (Green indicates presence)\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Certain Unnamed columns still exist which will be treated in the pre-processing stages.\nThe above plots show that we did not observe any null values at all. We found a collection of many different datasets all relating to the teams in the premier league. Then we were able to join together some of the important attributes in the tables. This joined dataset we created is what we searched for null values in, and we found none."
