    "text": "1 Introduction\nNovember 30th, 2023 EDAV Professor Robbins\nMoneyball - How to win the Premier League (Tyler Freund, Yash Dange)\nBackground on our Data:\nThe Premier League is the most prestigious and highest level of competitive\nsoccer in England.  It is the most followed soccer league in the world,\nproducing the biggest superstars in the sport and the strongest teams.  The\npremier league brought in over $6.9 billion dollars in revenue between\n2021-2022 and amassed over 4.7 billion viewers.  Given that this league is\nfollowed by such a large number of people and brings in such vast amounts of\nrevenue, better understanding why and how certain teams excel is an incredibly\nfascinating and important topic.  We were able to gather a diverse collection\nof datasets that cover a wide range of details relating to the teams in this\nleague.\nWhy you chose this topic:\nWe wanted to find a dataset we were both passionate about and interested in.  \nAfter extensive searching and exploring of datasets we decided to use the\npremier league soccer datasets.  We chose these datasets because we both love\nsports and believe we can find meaningful trends in the data that help\ndetermine what makes a winning team.  By identifying characteristics of\nwinning and losing teams we can help fans, investors, and teams themselves\nbetter understand what makes them successful.\nQuestions you are interested in studying:\nAs mentioned above, we want to discover what makes a winning team in the\npremier league. More concretely, we can research the attributes and statistics\nthat are most highly correlated with winning and losing. For instance, do\nhigher salaries mean a better chance of winning? How much more likely is a\nteam to win based on a winning previous season? Are teams with a strong player\nin a certain position more likely to win? We delve into these questions and\nmany more regarding how a team can become successful."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n2.1 Technical Description\nGiven the popularity of the sport and its apex league, it is not surprising to see the manifold sources which can be used to book-keep the data of the Premier League and its individual fixtures. Some popular sources are:\n\nPremier League Official Website: The official Premier League website offers statistics, fixtures, results, and historical data. While it might not provide APIs, the website itself is a good reference for up-to-date information.\nFootball Data APIs: o Opta: Opta provides detailed sports data, including football. They offer APIs that cover various football leagues, including the Premier League, delivering statistics, match events, player data, and more.\n\no Sportradar: Sportradar offers APIs with live and historical data for various sports, including football. Their services cover detailed match data, player statistics, and more for the Premier League.\n\nStatistical Websites: o Whoscored: Whoscored provides detailed statistics, including player ratings, team performance, and match data for various football leagues, including the Premier League.\n\no Transfermarkt: While primarily known for transfer-related data, Transfermarkt also offers comprehensive statistics, player information, and historical data for the Premier League.\n\nOpen Source Datasets: o GitHub Datasets: Some repositories on GitHub host curated football datasets, including Premier League data. You can find historical match results, player statistics, and more.\nAPI Platforms: o RapidAPI: Platforms like RapidAPI aggregate multiple APIs, including sports data providers. You can find football-related APIs on RapidAPI that cover the Premier League.\n\nFor the purpose of this project, we have taken into consideration the previous season of the Premier League (Season 2022/23) which concluded in May. This will allow us to perform in -depth analysis of an entire season.\nSOURCES USED:\nSource 1: Football Referee (https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/2022-2023/2022-2023-Premier-League-Stats)\nDescription: The dataset consists detailed records of the recently concluded 22/23 season of the English Premier League. It includes various metrics like possession, goalkeeping, playmaking, passing, etc and provides information from a twofold perspective (squad and v/s the squad). Provides ample opportunities for different observations using all kinds of graphs and plots.\nFormat: Excel Sheets (.xlsx) and Comma Separated Values (.csv) files. Frequency of Updates: Every Match-Week. (Note: Since we have taken into account the last season, there will be no additions or changes to the dataset used. The ‘weekly’ frequency refers to the usual timeline of football matches in the English Premier League held usually held every Saturday & Sunday, with exceptions being International Breaks, Emergencies and off-season breaks.)\nDimensions: 20 X 15 (Each sheet consists of different number of columns, depending on the aspect of the game it records. 15 is just a rough estimate of how many features may be present in each. The teams, however, stay the same and hence all sheets have 20 rows.)\nOther relevant information: For the uninitiated, certain terms commonly used in Football (or Soccer, in America) might feel like jargon. Hence, one can find the “glossary” section in the source link itself to better understand the meaning & full forms of abbreviations used as column names.\nPotential Shortcomings of the dataset: 1. No categorical variables as such – All features are of numerical datatypes. This is a nature of the sport itself, which demands limited ‘categorical’ input for analysis. 2. Needs Pre-processing and Cleaning - Data is spread into 23 different sheets (each acting as a dataset on its own) 3. Limited Size – The dataset consists of only 20 rows in each sheet, representing all 20 teams. This is different from a usual csv file which might consist millions of rows of data.\nSource 2: Official Website of the Premier League (https://www.premierleague.com/)\nThis is the official website of the English Premier League and acts as the official platform for all news, stats and records of the league. We primarily plan to use this as a ‘fact-check’ source to ensure the data represented on the third party source is authentic and not fabricated. Besides, the website also contains information not relevant to the purpose of our assignment.\nExternal Sources which might possible aid our research question (Financial Aspects) - https://www.transfermarkt.us/"

    "text": "2.2 Research Plan\n2.2 Research plan\nThe research question we’re primarily trying to answer is – “What makes a Premier League Champion?” Analyzing a Premier League dataset to understand the key factors that contribute to a team becoming a champion involves exploring various aspects of the game. Here’s a detailed approach:\n\nPerformance Metrics: Goals Scored and Conceded. Explore the relationship between a team’s goal-scoring ability and defensive solidity. Champions often have a high goal-scoring rate coupled with a solid defense. Possible Graphs – Line Chart, Bar Chart.\nPossession and Style of Play: Possession Statistics: Examine possession stats to understand if champions tend to dominate possession or are effective in counter-attacking. Passing Accuracy and Style: Analyze passing accuracy and patterns to determine if champions have a particular style of play (possession-based, direct play, etc.) Possible Graphs – Area Chart, Heatmap.\nEfficiency and Expected Goals (xG): Expected Goals (xG): Evaluate expected goals statistics to gauge a team’s offensive efficiency. Compare actual goals scored to expected goals to identify teams that overperform or underperform based on expected metrics. Possible Graphs - Scatter Plot, Line Chart.\nDefensive Strength: Clean Sheets and Goals Conceded: Assess the number of clean sheets and goals conceded by champions. A strong defense is often a crucial factor in winning the title. Possible Graphs - Bar Chart/ Line Chart.\nIndividual Player Performance: Key Player Contributions: Analyze individual player statistics such as top goal scorers, assists, key passes, successful tackles, interceptions, etc., to identify the impact of star players on the team’s success. Possible Graphs – Bar Chart, Radar Chart. Additional Data from the same source (FBRef) will be required for individual player analysis*\nGoalkeeping Performance: Goalkeeper Stats: Evaluate goalkeeper statistics such as save percentage, clean sheets, saves made, etc., to understand the influence of goalkeeping on the team’s success. Possible Graphs - Bar Chart or Pie Chart. Illustrating goalkeeper statistics like save percentage, clean sheets, saves made, etc., for different goalkeepers.\nTackles Won and Defensive Actions: Tackles and Defensive Stats: Assess the number of tackles won, interceptions, blocks, clearances, etc., to understand a team’s defensive work rate and effectiveness.Possible Graphs - Bar Chart or Area Chart: Displaying tackles won, interceptions, blocks, clearances, etc., to showcase defensive actions.\nConsistency and Form: Home vs. Away Performance: Analyze a team’s performance at home versus away games to understand consistency. Form Across the Season: Check for streaks, runs of consecutive wins, and periods of good form to identify critical phases of the season for champions. Plot: Line Chart/ Area Chart\nMatch Analysis: Results Against Top Teams: Analyze results against direct competitors or top teams to understand the team’s performance in crucial matches. Performance in Critical Fixtures: Evaluate performance in high-pressure matches towards the end of the season. Plot: Line/Bar Chart\n\nBy dissecting and analyzing various facets of the dataset as mentioned above, we can uncover patterns and trends that distinguish championship-winning teams in the Premier League. Integrating multiple metrics and adopting a holistic approach will provide a comprehensive understanding of our research question - What makes a Premier League champion?"

We decided to explore the relationship between points and goals scored (by a squad and against a squad). Each squad has two dots on the plot; a red dot indicating goals scored (offense) and a blue dot indicating goals conceded (defense). Both are certainly correlated with better/worse league performance (points), but we do observe a stronger correlation of points and goals scored; suggesting that offense could be more important for success in the league!"

This box plot shows the distribution of the number of yellow cards, by team groups (ranked by total league points). We split the 20 total teams into the top 5 best teams, 2nd 5 best, 3rd 5 best, and worst 5 teams. Then we see how they compare based on the number of yellow cards. We can see that there is a clear relationship between fewer yellow card penalties and better league performance. This suggests that maybe keeping it cool and staying composed can actually help a team succeed."

To answer this we explored the relationship between total goals scored and the number of progressive passes throughout the season. We ranked the teams by number of goals scored and then grouped them into top 5, 5th-10th, 11th-15th, and bottom 5 teams. Then we plotted the density curve of the number of passes for each group/subset. We found that there is clearly a correlation between more passes/ball movement and more goals scored. While players may want the attention of scoring a goal themselves, it may be in the best interest of the team to pass the ball and share the spotlight with one another."

Specifically, we explored clean sheet percentage (cs_percent) defined as the % of games the goalie allowed zero goals by the opponent, save percentage (save_percent) defined as the percentage of shots that were blocked by the goalie, and penalty kick save percentage (pk_save_percent) defined as the percentage of penalty kicks that were blocked by the goalie. We grouped the goalies into 4 groups ranked by their win percentage (i.e. games won divided by total games in the season) and used these groups to color code the lines in our plot. We see that the save_percent was not strongly correlated with goalies that win a lot; however, our other two metrics pk_save_percent and cs_percent are both highest for goalies that had high winning percentage and lowest for goalies that lost many matches. Thus, this displays the key role goalies play in a team’s success."

In this plot we explore the relationship between winning games and various possession metrics including: Total distance (total distance traveled with ball), progressive distance (total forward distance traveled with ball), total carries (number of times a player controls the ball), and progressive carries (number of times a player controls the ball and moves forward). We see from our biplot that all of these metrics are associated with more winning teams than losing teams, proving that indeed maintaining possession and holding the ball in control help teams reach success."

Using the ggsoccer library, we drew one half of pitch (since this was the area of interest). 2. In the ‘Opponent Shooting Stats’ sheet of the data, there was a column for the average shot distance for all shots taken against all teams. 3. Keeping the value of this distance the same, we generated random (x,y) coordinates so that they could be plotted on the pitch with the centre of the goal kept at the centre. 4. ‘Color’ attribute was added to the ‘SoT’ (Shots on Target) variable indicating shot accuracy. On a similar note, the size variable was attributed to the G/SoT variable.\nGraph Components:  Pitch Visualization: Half-pitch representation focusing on the area of interest, depicting the goal's center.  'X' Marks on the Pitch: Represent shot locations against different teams.  Color Attribute (Red Tones): Indicates shot accuracy (%SoT) against teams, brighter red for higher accuracy.  Size of 'X' Marks: Represents Goals per Shot on Target (G/SoT) against teams. Larger 'X' marks indicate a higher number of goals per shot on target. Inferences:\n\nDistance vs. Shot Accuracy: There isn't a consistent negative correlation between shot distance and the percentage of shots on target. For example, teams facing Liverpool took shots from a considerable distance, yet the %SoT remains relatively high.\nShots on Target vs. Actual Goals: Merely having shots on target doesn't guarantee scoring. This is evident from the smaller 'X' mark size against Liverpool, suggesting lower conversion rates of shots into actual goals.\nDefense Impact: Teams facing opponents who take shots from a distance indicate a strong defense strategy. These opponents are forced into taking distant shots, implying the defense doesn't allow close-range opportunities.\n\nKey Insights:  Defensive Strategy: A robust defense that prevents opponents from getting close to the goal might result in shots taken from a distance. While this doesn't necessarily lead to off-target shots, it does increase the chances of easier saves for an experienced goalkeeper.  Shot Conversion Complexity: A high percentage of shots on target doesn't guarantee higher goal conversion. Quality shot placement and finishing skill are crucial for turning shots on target into actual goals.  Balance Needed: Balancing defensive resilience to deter close-range shots with effective attack strategies to improve shot quality and conversion rates is vital for team success.\nConclusion: The analysis suggests that while keeping opponents at a distance from the goal may result in distant shots, it doesn't guarantee lower shot accuracy. The focus should be on maintaining a strong defense to limit close-range opportunities while improving offensive strategies for higher-quality shots and better conversion rates. Achieving this balance is critical for a team's performance and success."

More blue signifies better control over that area.  Comparison between Squad and Opponent Touches: The comparison between a team's touches and those of its opponents in each third. Inferences:\n\nTeam's Control and Playing Style: The dominance of blue hues in each third signifies the team's control over specific areas. More touches in the attacking half suggest an aggressive playing style, while conceding touches in the defensive half implies a more conservative approach.\nObservations: o Balanced Touches: Initially, there appears to be a balance between a team's and its opponent's touches in each third, with no clear trends. o Domination by Select Teams: Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, and Brighton showcase dominance across the entire pitch, indicating their slow and intricate, possession-based style. o Poor Ball Retention: Teams like Nottingham Forest, West Ham, and Bournemouth show inadequate ball retention across all thirds, signifying a lack of control over the ball. o Liverpool's Contrasting Pattern: Liverpool stands out with opponents having more touches in their defense, yet they dominate the middle and attacking thirds. This may be attributed to their high-press strategy and direct approach to scoring.\nCorrelation with Results: o Effectiveness of Ball Retention: More blue hues generally correlate with better results. Teams like Everton, West Ham, and Wolves with lower touch values finished in the bottom half. o Goals vs. Possession: Notably, possessing more doesn't necessarily result in more goals. Chelsea, despite showing dominance, finished lower in the league, emphasizing Jose Mourinho's quote: \"They can take the ball home. I’ll take the three points.\"\n\nConclusion:  Control and Strategy: The distribution of touches across different thirds reflects a team's playing style - whether aggressive or conservative.  Performance vs. Possession: While possession is crucial, its correlation with positive outcomes varies. Effective ball retention in critical thirds contributes to success, but goals and results don't always align with possession dominance.  Varied Approaches: Different teams showcase distinct strategies, emphasizing the importance of balance between possession, defensive stability, and converting opportunities into goals for achieving favorable outcomes."

The definitions categorize short passes as those below 15 yards, medium passes between 15-30 yards, and long passes exceeding 30 yards. 1. Short Passes: These passes, indicated by the minimal inward movement on the graph, show a high rate of successful completion. Teams seem proficient in short passing, as there is minimal deviation from attempts to successful completions. 2. Medium Passes: The transition from short to medium attempts is evident, showcasing that some teams opt for more short passes than completing medium ones. However, the graph demonstrates a relatively smooth transition from attempts to successful completions in the medium range, indicating a reasonable success rate. 3. Long Passes: There is a substantial drop in both the number of attempts and successful completions for long passes. This decline could imply the difficulty associated with executing long passes successfully. Long passes, often crosses or through balls, demand high precision and are susceptible to interceptions, which might explain the reduced success rate. While long passes can offer direct goal- scoring opportunities, they tend to be riskier and less successful, especially against stronger opposition. Overall, the graph portrays that while short and medium passes are executed with relative success, there's a significant challenge associated with converting long passes due to their precision demands and vulnerability to interceptions. Teams might find it challenging to execute these longer passes effectively, contributing to a lower success rate in this pass category."

This physically demanding nature of the game has led to players retiring into their early 30s, and new players being introduced in their teens. This trend has resulted in a decarese in the overall squad age for teams across the years.\nThe graph aims to examine the relationship between squad age, fouls committed (measured by yellow cards), and goals conceded. Two key inquiries guide this analysis: a. Do older squads tend to commit more fouls due to potential challenges in keeping up with younger opponents? b. Does committing fouls serve as an effective strategy in preventing goals or create favorable defensive opportunities through resulting free kicks? Observations and Findings 1. Fouls Committed by Age: Contrary to expectations, there's no substantial evidence suggesting that older squads (&gt;28 years) commit more fouls indicated by yellow cards. Even younger squads, exemplified by Arsenal, exhibit a propensity for committing fouls. Age does not significantly correlate with the number of fouls committed. 2. Effectiveness of Fouls in Preventing Goals: Fouls, primarily intended to impede opponents and prevent clear goal-scoring chances, do not seem to significantly impact goals conceded. There's no apparent relationship between committing more fouls and conceding fewer goals. The data does not support the idea that fouls effectively prevent goals.\nConclusion: The analysis indicates a lack of strong correlation between squad age, fouls committed, and goals conceded in football. Older squads do not exhibit a tendency to commit more fouls, nor do higher foul counts lead to fewer goals conceded. Overall, the findings suggest that age and fouls committed, as well as fouls committed and goals conceded, are largely uncorrelated factors in determining team performance in football. This analysis highlights the nuanced nature of football dynamics, suggesting that while age and fouls are measurable metrics, their direct impact on match outcomes appears inconclusive."

It factors in various elements like shot location, type, and assist type to determine the likelihood of a shot resulting in a goal. Interpretation: The visualization showcases yellow and blue bar charts along the same axis, illustrating the relationship between expected and actual goals scored. - Yellow Bar (Terminating with Yellow Ball):** Represents actual goals scored during matches. When the yellow ball extends beyond the yellow bar, it indicates that the team scored more goals than statistically anticipated. This suggests their ability to convert chances that weren’t in their favor statistically.\n\nBlue Bar (Terminating with Red Ball): Represents Expected Goals (xG). When a blue line is visible, it signifies that the actual goals scored were fewer than the expected goals (xG). This indicates the team's inability to capitalize on the goal-scoring opportunities they created. Observations:\nMany teams have outperformed statistically predicted goal-scoring outcomes, as highlighted by the significant distance between the yellow and blue balls. Notable standouts include Manchester City and Arsenal.\nConversely, teams like Everton, Chelsea, and Wolves fell short of converting their chances into goals, evident from the smaller distance or overlap between the yellow and red balls.\nThis analysis emphasizes that top-performing teams not only create goal-scoring opportunities but also capitalize on them, scoring even from unlikely scenarios. The analysis of Expected Goals (xG) versus actual goals scored reveals how teams convert scoring opportunities. It shows that some teams consistently outperform their expected goals, displaying a knack for efficient goal conversion. Others struggle to match their xG, pointing to inefficiencies in finishing or decision-making. This analysis highlights the importance of efficient goal conversion and its impact on match outcomes in football.\n\nResults Summary\nThroughout the creation of our 10 visualizations we identified numerous keys to becoming a successful soccer team in the premier league. From avoiding penalties to choosing the right position on the field to shoot, there are many insights from the data that can be utilized by coaches, players, and fans to better assess a team’s/player’s performance. We will discuss some of the most prominent discoveries that we made through our study:\nClearly, having both a strong offensive and defensive team is very important, but based upon our correlation between goals scored/conceded and final league points, we found that offense showed a stronger correlation with winning.\nPenalties have an immediate negative impact on teams, but are these penalties significant enough to result in a better overall record for the season? According to our results, they absolutely do. We observe an obvious relationship between winning teams and fewer penalties and losing teams and more penalties.\nNobody likes a ball hog, but in professional level soccer does passing and sharing the ball actually help a team win? Based upon our findings, passing the ball and sharing it with your teammates actually is an attribute of a winning team.\nCan an exceptional goalie lead a team to victory? Measured by clean sheets (games where goalie allows no goals from the opponent) we definitely see a connection with exceptional goalies and winning teams.\nThe goalie position is essential and serves as the final line of defense against the opponent, but is a team’s defensive ability measured solely by the goalie? Certainly not, in fact, we found that the best teams goalies had to do the least amount of work and had to block fewer shots at the goal (likely due to the fact that good teams have strong defensive players who don’t let the opponent shoot at the goalie in the first place).\nCloser shots are easier to make… right? Well, according to our analysis we found that longer shots actually yielded higher accuracy ratings.\nDoes playing aggressively lead to more success? We explored how teams behaved with the ball in the attacking third area of the field. We saw that teams who were aggressive and took more shots rather than passes in the attacking third area were generally teams with more winning records. So shoot your shot when in range!\nPatience is key, slow and steady wins the race. Comparing the completion of short, medium and long distance passes; it is clear that long passes are incredibly risky and show a very low completion rate. Thus, it is better to stick with short and medium distance passes to avoid losing the ball to the opponent."

To interact with the plot you simply need to hover the mouse over the different chunks of the pie to see what percentage of total goalie saves were from a given group of goalies. The groups were created using the number of wins (ie top 5 are the top 5 goalies with most wins). Our results were actually surprising and quite different from what we expected. We initially thought that the better teams/goalies would have a higher percentage of saves. However, we actually discovered that the best teams have the least percentage of total saves. After thinking about this result more deeply, we realized that this is in fact intuitive. This is because the best teams control the ball more and prevent the other team from even entering a position where they can get a shot at the goal. Thus, it would make sense that the best teams would actually have the fewest number of saves since they have fewer shots coming at their goalies in total. This visualization helps us understand that while having a strong goalie is important, it may be equally important to have defensive players who prevent the opponent from ever even getting a shot at the goalie."

    "text": "Decoding Premier League Success: A Multifaceted Analysis\nIn exploring the English Premier League 2022/23 season, our in-depth investigation into various aspects of the game such as possession, goal-keeper statistics, shooting, has unraveled the various factors influencing a team's triumphs and setbacks on the field. Some of the concluding bullets have been listed below:\nDefensive Strategies and Offensive Efficiency\nOur analysis of shot dynamics proved the assumption that distance from goal correlates with reduced shot accuracy wrong. It underscored the significance of defensive resilience while emphasizing the crucial role of shot quality and conversion rates for goal-scoring success.\nDominance and Control on the Field\nThe examination of possession and control across different pitch sections revealed distinctive playing styles and attributes among teams. From comprehensive possession-based gameplay of Manchester City to high-press strategies like that of Liverpool, each team's approach to controlling various parts of the pitch showcased unique strengths and strategies.\nPassing Dynamics: Precision and Challenges\nThe radial graph dissecting pass distribution underscored not exactly the challenges associated with executing long passes, but their scarce nature instead. While short and medium passes displayed higher success rates, the graph highlighted the considerable difficulty in executing longer passes due to precision demands and vulnerability to interceptions.\nAge, Fouls, and Defensive Strategies\nContrary to expectations, age didn't significantly correlate with fouls committed, challenging the idea of older squads committing more fouls and being more ‘lazy’ and grumpy (resorting to fouling instead of running and tracing back). Furthermore, our analysis established that a robust relationship between fouls committed and goals conceded does not exist, questioning the efficacy of fouls as a defensive strategy.\nExpected Goals vs. Actual Goals\nThe comparison between expected and actual goals scored illuminated teams' abilities to surpass statistical predictions. Some consistently exceeded expectations, while others struggled to convert chances into goals, emphasizing that statistical predictions might not always reflect on on-field outcomes.\nInsights from Additional Visualizations\nSupporting visualizations reinforced critical aspects influencing a team's success, encompassing correlations between goals scored, possession metrics, defensive strategies, and goalkeeper performance.\nKey Takeaways for Premier League Success\nOur collective findings underline the multifaceted nature of success in the Premier League:\n\nBalanced Strategies: Teams must strike a balance between defensive solidity and offensive efficiency.\nControl and Possession: While possession dominance is valuable, it doesn't always guarantee positive outcomes.\nPrecision and Execution: The challenges associated with long passes highlight the need for a balanced passing game.\n\nKey Takeaways:\nThe diverse analyses undertaken underscore that achieving success in the Premier League demands a blend of tactical prowess, adaptability to (and resilience against) varied playing styles, and a keen understanding of nuanced game dynamics. Success isn't solely defined by traditional metrics but by a delicate balance between defense, offense, possession, and adaptability.\nThis comprehensive analysis doesn't just decode the components of Premier League success; it reshapes our understanding of the beautiful game's intricacies, offering invaluable insights for players, teams and fans alike. It's a testament to the complicated nature of the world’s most competitive league, and shows why no simple answer to the question ‘How to win the Premier League’ exists."
